# Allure Results Parser

Welcome to the **Allure Results Parser**! This GitHub Action makes it super easy to parse your Allure test results in JSON format and get key metrics about your tests. Whether you're tracking passed, failed, or skipped tests, we've got you covered!

## How it works

This action simplifies the process of extracting important metrics from your Allure JSON files. You can effortlessly gather essential information such as the number of tests that passed, failed, broken, or were skipped, along with the total count of tests and the overall duration of the test run. With this action, you can gain valuable insights into your testing process, allowing you to make data-driven decisions to improve your test suite.


## Inputs

Here's what you need to provide:

| Name               | Description                                       | Required | Default           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------|
| `allure_directory` | The path to the folder containing your Allure JSON files | Yes      | `./allure-results` |

## Outputs
